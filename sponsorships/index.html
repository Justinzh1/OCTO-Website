                <p id="about-p">Through the ASUC Office of the CTO, countless students now have the ability to more easily ensure their safety, refine their eating and exercise habits, figure out their future coursework, and to access the plethora of resources that we have available on campus. Currently, we are hard at work to improve campus by adding new features to our software that will boost students' health, wellness, and efficiency. That being said, we would not be able to keep the office running without the help of our sponsors, whose contributions have provided us with much-needed hardware and have covered both server costs and hack-session materials.
